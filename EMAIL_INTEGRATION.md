## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Already installed:
- `resend` - Modern email API service
- `nodemailer` - SMTP email sending
- `@types/nodemailer` - TypeScript types

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create or update your `.env.local` file with:

```bash
# Resend Configuration (Recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM="Your Store <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

# SMTP Fallback Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Get Resend API Key

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Verify your sending domain or use their test domain
3. Create an API key in the dashboard
4. Add it to your environment variables

### 4. Configure SMTP (Optional but Recommended)

For Gmail:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an App Password in Google Account settings
3. Use the app password as `SMTP_PASS`

## Email Template Content

The email includes:

### Header Section
- Welcome message in Bengali and English
- Thank you note with branding

### Order Summary

- Payment method

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/send-email`
Manually send order confirmation email.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "orderNumber": "ORD-1234567890"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Order confirmation email sent successfully",
  "emailId": "email-id-from-service",
  "service": "resend"
}
```

### Updated POST `/api/orders`
Now automatically sends confirmation email after order creation.

## Usage

### Automatic Sending
Emails are sent automatically when:
1. Customer completes checkout process
2. Order is successfully created in database
3. Email service is properly configured

### Manual Sending
Use the `SendEmailButton` component in admin interfaces:

```tsx
import SendEmailButton from "@/components/admin/SendEmailButton";

<SendEmailButton 
  orderNumber="ORD-1234567890" 
  customerEmail="customer@example.com" 
/>
```

## Error Handling

The system handles errors gracefully:

1. **Email service failures**: Falls back to SMTP if Resend fails
2. **Order creation**: Continues even if email sending fails
3. **Missing configuration**: Logs errors without breaking the application
4. **Invalid email addresses**: Validates before sending

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logs
Check console logs for:
- Email sending success/failure
- Service failover events
- Configuration issues

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**
   - Check RESEND_API_KEY is valid
   - Verify EMAIL_FROM domain is verified in Resend
   - Check SMTP credentials if using fallback

2. **Emails going to spam**
   - Verify sender domain in Resend
   - Use a proper business email address
   - Add SPF/DKIM records to your domain

3. **Template not displaying correctly**
   - Check for HTML syntax errors
   - Test in different email clients
   - Verify inline CSS styling

## Customization

### Email Template
Modify the HTML template in `lib/email.ts`:
- Update branding and colors
- Add/remove sections
- Customize styling
- Update contact information

### Business Information
Update these sections in the template:
- Company name and logo
- Contact phone/email
- Support hours
- Shipping policies

### Languages
Currently supports Bengali and English. To add more languages:
1. Update the template content
2. Add language detection logic
3. Create separate templates if needed

## Testing

### Development Testing
1. Set up email configuration
2. Place a test order
3. Check console logs for email sending status
4. Verify email received in inbox

### Production Testing
1. Test with real customer emails
2. Verify email deliverability
3. Check spam folder handling
4. Test mobile email display

## Security Considerations

- Store API keys in environment variables only
- Use app passwords for SMTP, never account passwords
- Validate email addresses before sending
- Rate limit email sending to prevent abuse
- Log email attempts for security monitoring

## Performance

- Email sending is asynchronous and doesn't block order creation
- Failed emails are logged but don't affect user experience
- Automatic fallback ensures high delivery rates
- Template is optimized for fast rendering

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Email templates for order status updates
2. SMS notifications
3. Email analytics and tracking
4. A/B testing for email content
5. Customer email preferences
6. Bulk email capabilities for marketing

## Support

For issues with email integration:
1. Check environment variables configuration
2. Review console logs for errors
3. Test with different email addresses
4. Verify email service status
5. Check spam/junk folders

Remember to test thoroughly in both development and production environments before going live.
